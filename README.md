# Research Topics
This is a quick Repo designed to hold just the ReadMe.md which contains some information I was requested to research on DevOps, the Netlist File format, the REST API and the simlarities and differences between MongoDB and CouchDB.

1. DevOps is a compound "word" originating from the terms "Software **Dev**elopment" and "Information Technology **Op**eration**s**" and is meant to reflect the communication and teamwork between software developers and IT professionals, while optimizing and automating the delivery and infastructure changes of software delivery. The concept of DevOps is a cultural and environmental way of thinking that is similar to forms of Agile Development but focuses more on organization due to the larger amounts of software building and release that come from Agile concepts. Benefits of implementing a DevOps structure in a company have been (but not limited to) a shorter time to market for a product, better product quality, rapid experimentation and development, and increased customer satisfaction. Three cultural changes must take place in order to adopt DevOps into a company culture, according to Gene Kim in his "Three Ways Principles" concept. The first change must be in systems thinking; The change emphasis is on the performance of the entire system, as opposed to individual departments. The second change must be in amplifying feedback loops; Listening to, learning from, and increasing feedback from the teams involved in the company to increase communication amongst the teams and the customers involved. The third change must be in company culture, and keeping the experimentation and subsequent learning experience; The changes in risk taking attiute, communication and practice have to be a constant part of the way the company thinks.
